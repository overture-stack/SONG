What is SONG?
======================

`SONG <https://www.overture.bio/products/song>`_ is a robust metadata and validation system used to quickly and reliably track genome metadata scattered across multiple cloud storage systems. 
In the field of genomics and bioinformatics, metadata managed by simple solutions such as spreadsheets and text files require significant time and effort to maintain and ensure the data is reliable. 
With several users and thousands of genomic files, tracking the state of metadata and their associations can become a nightmare. 
The purpose of SONG is to minimize human intervention by imposing rules and structure to user uploads, which as a result produces high quality and reliable metadata with a minimal amount of effort. 
SONG is one of many products provided by `Overture <https://overture.bio>`_ and is completely open-source and free for everyone to use.

    Did you know that **SONG** is actually a recurrsive acronym for
    **S**\ ONG's **O**\ ur **N**\ ew **G**\ NOS? 
    
    GNOS (Genomic Network Operating System) was a genomic data repository built and maintained by Annai Systems, which ceased operation in 2017. In response to the vacant position for a genomic metadata system, **SONG** was born.

Data Submission Workflow
======================================

The data submission workflow can be separated into 4 main stages:

1. Metadata Upload (SONG)
2. Metadata Saving (SONG)
3. Object data Upload (SCORE)
4. Publishing Metadata (SONG)


The following diagram summarized the steps involved in successful data submission using SONG and SCORE:

Getting Started
============================

The easiest way to understand SONG, is to simply use it! 
Below is a short list of different ways to get started on interacting with SONG.

Tutorial using a CLI with Docker for SONG
----------------------------------------------------
The :ref:`Docker for SONG tutorial <docker_tutorial_ref>` is a great way to spin-up SONG and all its dependent services using Docker on your host machine. Use this if you want to play with SONG locally. 
Refer to the :ref:`Docker for SONG <docker_for_song_ref>` documentation.

Tutorial using the Python SDK with SONG
-------------------------------------------
The :ref:`SONG Python SDK Tutorial <sdk_python_tutorial_ref>` is a Python client module that is used to interact with a running SONG server. Use it with one of the :ref:`Projects Using SONG <_intro_projects_using_song_ref>`, or in combination with :ref:`Docker for SONG <docker_for_song_ref>`. For more information to about the Python SDK, refer to the :ref:`SONG Python SDK <song_python_sdk_ref>` documentation.

..
    Play with a CLI
    --------------------------
    If you want to play with SONG from your terminal, there are a few :ref:`Command Line Client <command_line_clients_ref>` tutorials to choose from, such as the :ref:`Java CLI Tutorial <java_cli_tutorial_ref>` or the :ref:`GO CLI Tutorial <go_cli_tutorial_ref>` .

Play with the REST API from your browser
--------------------------------------------
If you want to play with SONG from your browser, simply visit the Swagger UI for each server:

1. **Cancer Collaboratory - Toronto**: https://song.cancercollaboratory.org/swagger-ui.html
2. **AWS - Virginia**: https://virginia.song.icgc.org/swagger-ui.html

.. seealso::
    For more information about user access, refer to the :ref:`User Access <user_access_ref>` documentation.

Deploy SONG to Production
